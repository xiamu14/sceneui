# Getting started

Welcome to the SceneUI documentation!

SceneUI help you to make beautiful, modern, and fast websites regardless of your design experience, created with `React.js` and `Framer Motion` and
inspired by [NextUI](https://nextui.org/).

### Installation

Inside your React project directory, install SceneUI component by running either of the following:

```powershell
pnpm add @sceneui/xxx
```

### Setup

For auto import style, you need to set up the `vite-plugin-imp` in your `vite.config.js`.

```js vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import vitePluginSceneui from 'vite-plugin-sceneui';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [vitePluginScneneui()],
});
```
